## What do we mean by "air quality"?

## My role
<hr>

I am an "air quality data measurements analyst", but in reality I do a lot of stuff!

> As an overall summary, my work is centred around leveraging R to more effectively communicate air quality data to the public.

* Authoring "annual reports" in Quarto for different networks, as well as ad-hoc reports (e.g., "episode" reports).

* Performing data analysis and creating data visualisations across many different projects.

* Developing new tools to better analyse/visualise data (e.g., `{openair}`, `{openairmaps}`, `{worldmet}`, ...).

. . .

* Facilitate internal & external training to allow others to better understand their own data.

## Measuring air quality
<hr>

The UK has *a lot* of air quality measurement sites! We use these to track national compliance with AQ objectives, as well as to inform more local-scale policies.

<br>

:::aside
Note that this doesn't even cover the non-automatic networks (e.g., heavy metals) or the non-national networks operated by local authorities!

```{r}
#| label: networkMap
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "600"
openairmaps::networkMap(c("aurn", "aqe", "waqn", "saqn", "ni"), cluster = FALSE)
```

## Dynamic Reporting
<hr>

We create *a lot* of dynamic reports using `{rmarkdown}` (although we're slowly transitioning to [Quarto](https://quarto.org)!).

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
* Air quality data lends itself to **automatic** reporting as it:

  1. ...is always in a consistent format (date, pollutant concentrations).
  
  2. ...is added to our databases continuously after ratification.
  
* We also create ad-hoc reports in response to pollution "episodes" (particulate matter episodes on bonfire night, ozone episodes during heatwaves, etc.).

::::

Dynamic reports are an excellent middle ground between traditional reports and data dashboards, providing a strong narrative *and* extensibility.

## The `{openair}` package
<hr>

> `{openair}` is an R package developed for the purpose of analysing air quality data â€” or more generally atmospheric composition data. The package is extensively used in academia, the public and private sectors.

It has been around for *a long* time --- over a decade! This means some things are a bit odd for newer R users (e.g., use of `{lattice}` over `{ggplot2}`!). Key question - how can we best leverage it in this rapidly developing world of R programming?

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}

```{r}
#| label: fig-calendarplot
#| fig-cap: "A 'calendar plot' - a heatmap in a familiar calendar format."
#| echo: false
openair::calendarPlot(openair::mydata, year = 2000)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-theilsen
#| fig-cap: "A 'Theil Sen trend' - a robust trend fit to a timeseries."
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
openair::TheilSen(openair::mydata, avg.time = "month")
```

## `{openair}` aside: accessing data
<hr>

Even if you don't really care about air quality, `{openair}` (and `{worldmet}`) can still be useful to you as they provide access to *lots* of timeseries data!

```{r}
#| label: loaddata
library(openair)
london_data <- importAURN(c("my1", "kc1"), year = 2022, meta = TRUE)
london_data
```

## Directional analysis I
<hr>

Answers the question *"where is the pollution coming from?"* ^[As opposed to "trend analysis", *"how are concentrations changing?"*]
<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| label: fig-windrose
#| fig-cap: "Wind speed & direction"
#| fig-height: 6
openair::windRose(openair::mydata)
```
:::

:::{.column width="10%"}

:::{.column width="45%"}

:::{.fragment}

```{r}
#| label: fig-pollrose
#| fig-cap: "Wind dir. & concentration"
#| fig-height: 6
openair::pollutionRose(openair::mydata, "nox")

```

## Enter `{openairmaps}`!

*Part of the wider "openair toolkit" along with `{openair}`, `{worldmet}` and `{deweather}`.*

The purpose of `{openairmaps}` was to combine `{openair}`'s directional analysis with the `{leaflet}` package (& javascript library) to create interactive air quality maps that help us **triangulate pollution sources** and understand local air quality in its **geographical context**.

<br>

```{r}
#| label: centralLondon
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "650"
openairmaps::polarMap(openairmaps::polar_data, "nox", popup = "site", d.icon = 300, alpha = 3/4)
```

## Package Development
<hr>

Once I got started, I was hooked! Every time you *think* you're done, you're dragged back in to expand on the functionality further.

![](images/timeline.svg){width=100%}

. . .

Being in the position to *teach* the package also allows a developer to understand what users are actually interested in.
