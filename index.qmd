## What do we mean by "air quality"?

## My role
<hr>

I am an "air quality data measurements analyst", but in reality I do a lot of stuff!

> As an overall summary, my work is centred around leveraging R to more effectively communicate air quality data to the public.

* Authoring "annual reports" in Quarto for different networks, as well as ad-hoc reports (e.g., "episode" reports).

* Performing data analysis and creating data visualisations across many different projects.

* Developing new tools to better analyse/visualise data (e.g., `{openair}`, `{openairmaps}`, `{worldmet}`, ...).

. . .

* Facilitate internal & external training to allow others to better understand their own data.

## Measuring air quality
<hr>

The UK has *a lot* of air quality measurement sites! We use these to track national compliance with AQ objectives, as well as to inform more local-scale policies.

:::aside
Note that this doesn't even cover the non-automatic networks (e.g., heavy metals) or the non-national networks operated by local authorities!

```{r}
#| label: networkMap
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "600"
openairmaps::networkMap(c("aurn", "aqe", "waqn", "saqn", "ni"), cluster = FALSE)
```


## The `{openair}` package
<hr>

> `{openair}` is an R package developed for the purpose of analysing air quality data â€” or more generally atmospheric composition data. The package is extensively used in academia, the public and private sectors.

* It has been around for *a long* time --- over a decade!

* Some things are a bit odd for newer R users (e.g., use of `{lattice}` over `{ggplot2}`!)

* How can we best leverage it in this rapidly developing world of R programming?

## `{openair}` aside: accessing data
<hr>

Even if you don't really care about air quality, `{openair}` (and `{worldmet}`) can still be useful to you as they provide access to *lots* of timeseries data!

```{r}
library(openair)
london_data <- importAURN(c("my1", "kc1"), year = 2022, meta = TRUE)
london_data
```

## Directional analysis I

## Simple example: Central London
<hr>

Below is a simple example of an `{openairmaps}` "polar map". Users only need to provide some data (with `ws`, `wd` and pollutant columns) and their chosen pollutant (here NO<sub>x</sub>).

<br>

```{r}
#| label: centralLondon
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "650"
openairmaps::polarMap(openairmaps::polar_data, "nox")
```
