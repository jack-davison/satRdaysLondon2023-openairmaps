Key pollutants:
- Nox (combustion, respiratory/cardio health)
- PM (variety of sources, variety of health effects)
- SO2 (similar to NOx, acid rain, forms secondary PM)
- NH3 (acidification, nitrification, and eutrophication)
- NMVOC (lots of sources, secondary PM, some directly carcinogenic)

WHO - air quality is up with obesity/smoking/etc. in terms of public health impacts
Ella Kissi-Debrah - first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death
Evidence continues to mount - air pollution is bad for lung capacity, mental health, physical health
"At risk" people (pregnant, elderly, young) are most affected
Causes of bad air often correlate w/ other issues (climate, societal atomisation,)

## My role
<hr>

I am an "air quality data measurements analyst", but in reality I do a lot of stuff!

> As an overall summary, my work is centred around leveraging R to more effectively communicate air quality data to the public.

* Authoring "annual reports" in Quarto for different networks, as well as ad-hoc reports (e.g., "episode" reports).

* Performing data analysis and creating data visualisations across many different projects.

* Developing new tools to better analyse/visualise data (e.g., `{openair}`, `{openairmaps}`, `{worldmet}`, ...).

. . .

* Facilitate internal & external training to allow others to better understand their own data.

## Measuring air quality
<hr>

The UK has *a lot* of air quality measurement sites! We use these to track national compliance with AQ objectives, as well as to inform more local-scale policies.

<br>

:::aside
Note that this doesn't even cover the non-automatic networks (e.g., heavy metals) or the non-national networks operated by local authorities!

#| out-height: "600"
openairmaps::networkMap(c("aurn", "aqe", "waqn", "saqn", "ni"), cluster = FALSE)
```

## Dynamic Reporting
<hr>

We create *a lot* of dynamic reports using `{rmarkdown}` (although we're slowly transitioning to [Quarto](https://quarto.org)!).

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
* Air quality data lends itself to **automatic** reporting as it...

  1. ...is always in a consistent format (date, pollutant concentrations, met data).

  2. ...is added to our databases continuously after ratification.

* We also create ad-hoc reports in response to pollution "episodes" (particulate matter episodes on bonfire night, ozone episodes during heatwaves, etc.).

Dynamic reports are an excellent middle ground between traditional reports and data dashboards, providing a strong narrative *and* extensibility.

## The `{openair}` package
### Introduction
<hr>

> `{openair}` is an R package developed for the purpose of analysing air quality data â€” or more generally atmospheric composition data. The package is extensively used in academia, the public and private sectors.

It has been around for *a long* time --- over a decade! This means some things are a bit odd for newer R users (e.g., use of `{lattice}` over `{ggplot2}`!). Key question - how can we best leverage it in this rapidly developing world of R programming?

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}

```{r}
#| label: fig-calendarplot
#| fig-cap: "A 'calendar plot' - a heatmap in a familiar calendar format."
#| echo: false
openair::calendarPlot(openair::mydata, year = 2000)
```

## The `{openair}` package
### Data Access
<hr>

Even if you don't really care about air quality, `{openair}` (and `{worldmet}`) can still be useful to you as they provide access to *lots* of timeseries data!

```{r}
#| label: loaddata
library(openair)
london_data <- importAURN(c("my1", "kc1"), year = 2022, meta = TRUE)
london_data
```

## Enter `{openairmaps}`
<hr>

> Part of the wider "openair toolkit" along with `{openair}`, `{worldmet}` and `{deweather}`.

The purpose of `{openairmaps}` was to combine `{openair}`'s directional analysis with the `{leaflet}` package (& javascript library) to create interactive air quality maps that help us **triangulate pollution sources** and understand local air quality in its **geographical context**.

```{r}
#| label: centralLondon
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "500"
openairmaps::polarMap(openairmaps::polar_data, "nox", popup = "site", d.icon = 300, alpha = 3/4)
```

## Case Studies
### Trends Over Lockdown
<hr>

Once nice use of the easy layer control options is to view changes over time. For example, we can clearly see the huge impact of the COVID-19 lockdown in Oxford City Centre!

```{r}
#| label: layercontrol
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "600"
oxford_road <- importAURN(site = "OX", year = 2018:2022, meta = TRUE)
polarMap(oxford_road, "nox", # data, pollutant
         control = "year", # create control menu for the year
         upper = 20, limits = c(0, 250), # set limits so markers share them
         d.icon = 300, alpha = 3/4) # semi-transparency
```

## Case Studies
### Source Apportionment
<hr>

If we have a whole network of sites, we can triangulate potential sources. For example, where are likely sources in a nearby industrial site?

```{r}
#| label: nlincs
#| output-location: column
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "550"
library(dplyr)

# get data
nlincs_local <- importLocal(
  c("SCN6", "SC12", "SC10", "AMVL"), 
  year = 2021, meta = TRUE
)
nlincs_aurn <- importAURN(
  c("SCN2"), 
  year = 2021, meta = TRUE
)

# combine
nlincs_all <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  nlincs_local, nlincs_aurn
)

# reuse modelled met for local data
nlincs_all <-
  nlincs_all %>%
  select(-ws, -wd, -air_temp) %>%
  left_join(
    select(nlincs_aurn, date, ws:air_temp), 
    by = join_by(date)
  )

# polar plot map!
polarMap(
  nlincs_all, "pm10", alpha = 3 / 4,
  # use multiple providers
  provider = c("OpenStreetMap", "Esri.WorldImagery")
)
```

This is a surface-level analysis of a complex air quality situation - please do not draw any lasting conclusions about Scunthorpe from this map!

## Case Studies 
### 24 Hours in Central London
<hr>

Using different plots as markers can reveal even more interesting features - for example, the `polarAnnulus()` plot can show how pollution typically varies over a 24 hour period.

```{r}
#| label: londonannulus
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "600"
london <- importAURN(site = c('CLL2', 'MY1', 'KC1'), year = 2019, meta = TRUE)
annulusMap(london, d.icon = 300, c("nox", "pm10", "so2"), # multiple pollutants!
           provider = "CartoDB.Positron", # just to demo - a different provider
           cols = "viridis") # and a different colour palette
```

## How does this work "under the hood"?
### The `{leaflet}` package
<hr>

The `{leaflet}` package makes it really easy to construct interactive web maps. Look closely around the web and you'll find `{leaflet}` maps *everywhere*. An example of a map is shown below.

```{r}
#| label: leaflet
#| output-location: column
#| out-width: "100%"
#| out-height: "550"
library(leaflet)

oxford <-
  data.frame(
    lat = c(51.754474, 51.758900),
    lng = c(-1.260699, -1.259626),
    label = c("White Rabbit Pizza Restaurant", "Department of Statistics"),
    popup = c("Where all the tasty pizza comes from!", "The home of OxfordR!")
  )

leaflet(oxford) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat = ~lat,
             lng = ~lng,
             label = ~label,
             popup = ~popup)
```

## How does this work "under the hood"?
### The `{openairmaps}` way
<hr>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="27%"}
`leaflet::makeIcon()` function can create `{leaflet}` markers out of effectively any image. 

We save the `{openair}` plots in a temporary directory first, and then point `makeIcon()` at these images. 

Everything is contained in a nested dataframe so everything remains properly aligned!

#| label: dummy

#     leaflet -.->|data =| nested
#     addMarkers -.->|iconURL =| paths
#     addMarkers -.-> control & latlng & popup/label
#     end
```


## Package Development
<hr>

Once I got started, I was hooked! Every time you *think* you're done, you're dragged back in to expand on the functionality further.

![](images/timeline.svg){width=100%}

. . .

Being in the position to *teach* the package also allows a developer to understand what users are actually interested in.

## Future Directions
<hr>

Every time I think `{openairmaps}` is "done", something new comes along!

- Could trend analysis be better "baked in" to `{openairmaps}` to more easily compare AQ trends?

- Is there space for more straightforward maps, like "spot concentration" or DAQI maps?

- Are there any `{leaflet}` extensions that we could make use of? e.g., `{leaftime}`

. . . 

Potential future directions in the `{openair}` world?

- Proper `{ggplot2}` implementations of `{openair}` plots to allow for more customisation - a big refactor like that is hard work, however!

- Interactive (e.g., `{plotly}`) implementations of `{openair}` plots, given the growth of dynamic reporting.

- Something in the tables space - [had an early attempt a few years ago](https://jack-davison.quarto.pub/gt-openair/) but could it be expanded/packaged up?
